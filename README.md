Included is a little web generator of QR from web imput fed to a google QR generator. It then displays the QR for the iPhone app to read from and put into the iphone contact list.

It implements php script to post to the Google API. I believe the API is no longer available. Finding another QR generator would suffice.

Uses old iphone 4 version of apple collections of views and insert into contact list. 

Used Google QR api which may not be available any longer to generate the QR within the php web stack.
